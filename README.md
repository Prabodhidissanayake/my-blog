This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Get started

### Install npm packages and run

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds and runs the React App on port`3000`.

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
